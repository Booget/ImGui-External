<h1 align="center">ImGui External Base</h1>

  ## üñ•Ô∏è What is this?
- ‚ö° Hello all! I used to use noteffex's loader base for all my external ImGui projects. I got bored of using this and I wanted to make something of my own. This is all inspired by him but nothing was taken from his repo other than the idea (As you can probs tell). It simply utilizes viewports from the ImGui docking branch and hides the DX9 window as well as the console. Its very basic.

For any questions feel free to message me on discord, booget#0001!
